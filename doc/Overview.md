1. Once logged into the app, registered voters express their voices.
2. The Pebble voting client automatically encrypts the ballots upon casting, adjusting the difficulty to mathematically ensure that no ballot can be spoofed or opened before the end of the election.
3. The encrypted ballot is anonymously published onto a decentralized, publicly accessible bulletin board where voters can verify their ballot is taken into account.
4. To tally the votes, the community starts decrypting the content of the ballots and can access the results as soon as the election is over.
5. Any voter, candidate, election authority or NGO can independently decrypt the ballots, tally the election again, and make sure the announced results are 100% accurate.
